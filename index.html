            <h1>Stephanie Beres</h1>
                <p> I am a fullstack developer based in the Austin area. I enjoy 
                    creating sites based on UX designs that are modern and 
                    functional. 
                </p>
            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a recent graduate of the Thinkful fullstack flex 
                    program. I enjoy creating projects that are not only 
                    appealing to look at, but responsive, and help users 
                    solve a problem. 
                        
                    When I am not coding, you can find me outdoors hiking, 
                    biking, and playing with my pup Slider. 
                </p>
